Introduction
============

Welcome to the CMPT221 lab repository documentation.

This repo contains all the lab assignments I've been working on for CMPT221. Each lab builds on the previous one and covers different topics like web development, databases, and working with Flask.

Repository Structure
--------------------

Here's how the repo is organized:

* ``labs/`` - All the lab directories go here
  * ``lab-1/`` - Pull Requests (first lab!)
  * ``lab-2/`` - Setting up virtual environments
  * ``lab-3/`` - Connecting to PostgreSQL database
  * ``lab-4/`` - Using ORM with SQLAlchemy
  * ``lab-5/`` - Building a GUI (the intentionally bad one)
  * ``lab-6/`` - Login system with authentication
  * ``lab-8/`` - Unit testing with pytest
  * ``lab-9/`` - This documentation lab

Getting Started
---------------

If you're just starting out:

1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Set up a virtual environment (check out the :doc:`development` section)
3. Install everything from ``requirements.txt``
4. Read the instructions in each lab folder - they're pretty helpful

What This Course Covers
-----------------------

Throughout these labs, I've worked with:

* Flask - for building web applications
* PostgreSQL - our database of choice
* SQLAlchemy - makes database stuff way easier
* bcrypt - for password security
* pytest - testing our code
* Sphinx - what this documentation is built with!
